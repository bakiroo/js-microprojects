## 🚀 Using This Repository (For Learners)

You can clone this repository freely to study how different JavaScript UI and game projects work:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bakiroo/js-microprojects.git
cd js-microprojects
Then open any folder and launch its index.html in a browser to explore, modify, and learn.

Example:

bash
cd 2048
start index.html        # Windows
open index.html         # macOS
xdg-open index.html     # Linux
🧩 My Future Plan
I intend to gradually:

Rebuild each mini project from scratch using modern HTML/CSS/JS
Add clean documentation and comments
Possibly create tutorials or personal remakes (not redistributions)
These new remakes will be clearly separated and authored under my own code later.
